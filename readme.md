## Create a repo in one student's github and invite your fellow students to that repo(setting => collaborators)
	
- [ ] 1.a add a few junk files, like a readme and an index.js as well as your npm init -y files, something fo rpeople to make changes to
- [ ] 2. Have each person create a feature branch off of the shared repo
- [ ] 3. have each student create some new changes, ensure that some of you are editing the same files.
4. Once your changes are made, push your changes to the upstream and then create a pull request.
5. have each student leave a comment and an approval on each other's pull requests and then merge your pull requests into the main branch

6. Make sure at least one person creates a merge conflict and go through resolving that merge conflict locally
	6.a this means opening the branch wiht conflicts locally and merging main into that branch. (navigate to main branch, pull latest form main, change to your feature branch and run 'git merge main' resolve merge conflicts in vs code and push those changes, they should be updated in your PR and your PR shouldn't have a merge conflict anymore)
